Find jobs, build community

## Installation

Run `npm init -y` in both `taho-client` and `taho-server` to install the dependencies needed to run the frontend server and the API server respectively.

Run `npm install react-router-dom --save` in folder `taho-react` (make sure you have a version of React already installed in your computer).

## Development

Run `npm run dev` in both folders to run both servers in development mode, meaning they will reload when making changes to their files.
Running `npm run start` (in both folders) will run the projects in production mode.

Run `npm start` in folder `taho-react` to start a local instance of react in your browser.
