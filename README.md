## Installation

Run `npm init -y` in both `taho-client` and `taho-server` to install the dependencies needed to run the frontend server and the API server respectively.

## Development

Run `npm run dev` in both folders to run both servers in development mode, meaning they will reload when making changes to their files.
Running `npm run start` (in both folders) will run the projects in production mode.
